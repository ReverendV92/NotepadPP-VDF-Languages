# Notepad++ VDF Language Plugins

An updated version of the Valve Developer Format plugins for **Notepad++ versions 7.6.4** onwards.

Changes include updated syntax libraries and moving each format to its own `XML` file instead of a single "megafile" for simplicity of updating.

Place the `XML` files into `%appdata%\notepad++\uderdefinelangs\` and restart NotePad++ for them to take effect. 

It would be better to remove the old combined VDF language file from your NP++ root folder before installing these to prevent conflicts.

Feel free to suggest any changes or make requests. *Help me help you help us all.*
