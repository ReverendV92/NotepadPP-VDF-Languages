# Notepad++ VDF Language Plugins

An updated version of the Valve Data Format plugins for **Notepad++ versions 7.6.4** onwards.

Changes include updated syntax libraries and moving each format to its own `XML` file instead of a single "megafile" for simplicity of updating.

Place the `XML` files into `%appdata%\notepad++\userdefinelangs\` and restart NotePad++ for them to take effect. 

It would be better to remove the old combined VDF language file from your NP++ root folder before installing these to prevent conflicts.

Any deprecated commands or syntaxes have been moved to what I call the "Dodgy Command List", and will highlight in red to notify you that they're probably to be avoided. Obviously if you know what you're doing, you can disregard this, but you're not the majority of end users, so I don't need to warn you about it.

### Feedback welcome. *Help me help you help us all.*
If you find missing commands, have suggestions on how to improve the appearance, or find bugs. Please do not hesitate to make an issue post.
